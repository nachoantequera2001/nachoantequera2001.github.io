    <!-- Programming Skills Section -->
    <div id="programming_skills_anchor">
      <h2> Programming Skills </h2>
      <p> Java is the first programming language I ever worked with and the one I feel more comfortable in since most of my experience and previous projects have used Java as their primary programming language.
          I also have good experience working with relational databases using MySQL and I am really looking forward to keep developing my database manegement skills in some future projects that I want to start soon.
      </p>
      <p> I also have a basic but strong experience with Python and one of my short-term objectives is to learn more python because it has multiple applications and it is one of the most demanded programming languages in the software engineering industry.
          I am also very interested in Web3 and Blockchain developemtn and this is why I decided to start learning Solidity by myself last winter.
      </p>
      <p> Finally, I am really looking forward to this course because Web Development is a discipline I have always been interested in but that I have never really had the opportunity or time to seriously learn about.
          Here is a list of some other programming or IT skills that I have also experience with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Java: Proficient </li>
        <li> MySQL: Intermediate - Proficient </li>
        <li> Python: Intermediate</li>
