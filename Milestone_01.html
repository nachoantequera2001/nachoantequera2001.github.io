    <!-- Programming Skills Section -->
    <div id="programming_skills_anchor">
      <h2> Programming Skills </h2>
      <p> Java is the first programming language I ever worked with and the one I feel more comfortable in since most of my experience and previous projects have used Java as their primary programming language.
          I also have good experience working with relational databases using MySQL and i am really looking forward to keep developing my database manegement skills in some future projects that I want to start soon.
          I also have a basic but strong experience with Python and one of my short-term objectives is to learn more python because it has multiple applications and it is one of the most demanded programming languages in the software engineering industry.
          I am also very interested in Web3 and Blockchain developemtn and this is why I decided to start learning Solidity by myself last winter.
          Finally, I am really looking forward to this course because Web Development is a discipline I have always been interested in but that I have never really had the opportunity or time to seriously learn about.
          Here is a list of some other programming or IT skills that I have also experience with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Java: Proficient </li>
        <li> MySQL: Intermediate - Proficient </li>
        <li> Python: Intermediate</li>
        <li> Solidity: Basic </li>
        <li> R: Basic</li>
      </ul>

      <h2> General Interests </h2>
      <p> Football (Soccer) has always been my passion and my dream is to become a <span style="color:red">professional</span> football player. Football has given the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and even allowed to go to college in the United States
          and keep developing my academic career. I discovered sofware engineering and programming during my last years in highschool and I would love to find a job related to any of these disciplines.
          In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends and family, and I love watching drama and mind-twisting movies</p>
